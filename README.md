This program solves the Helmholtz's equation in a 2d periodic lattice using the Plane Wave Equation (PWE) method.
The lattice can have a square or hexagonal periodicity. Whatever pattern can be build inside the primitive cell.

Four structures are available:

-> Square lattice

-> Hexagonal lattice

-> Honey comb lattice

-> DFB structure
